
To implement a kernal call:
    - Optionally add an appropriate file for the call (eg io.asm).
    - Implement the call from scratch or pull code from OpenKERNAL.
    - If returning values, exit your function with a jmp to one of:
        return_a          - Returns A, X and Y are unmodified.
        return_xy         - Returns X and Y, A is unmodified.
        return_a_or_xy    - Returns A if C=1, X and Y if C=0.
    - Remove the dummy implementation from kernal/core.asm
    - Update the vector struct in kernel/vectors.asm
                              
To implement a hardware driver:
    - Add the generic device driver to hardware/...
    - Instantiate the driver in platform/xxx/xxx.asm

To add features to the CLI:
    - Just go for it :).

FoenixKERNAL - a CBM style ABI for 65c02 and 65816 Foenix computers.

FoenixKERNAL is a clean-room implementation of a CBM style "KERNAL" ABI
(Application Binary Interface) designed to be generally backwards
compatible with the C64 KERNAL as documented in the Commodore 64 
Programmer's Reference.

FoenixKERNAL is released under the GPL3 license with the kernel exception:
applications which merely make use of the kernel through ABI calls are NOT
considered 'derivative works'.
